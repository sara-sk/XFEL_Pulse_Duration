# XFEL_Pulse_Duration
Repository contains code as part of a project to determine the average pulse duration of FEL beams. This is done using the spectral method, where spike widths are determinded from the frequency domain, and extended to the temporal domain via a Fourier transform.
<br> <br> 
The Master branch contains the visual interface (interface.ipynb), which is used to access the algorithm. The Notebook cell must be run to insert a file, after which buttons will appear to prompt the analysis.
<br>
The data on which the model is trialled is provided in the "data" folder - note however that the data must be kept in the same folder as interface.ipynb to be ablle to load.
