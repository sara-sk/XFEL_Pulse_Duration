# XFEL_Pulse_Duration
Repository contains code in progress as part of a project to determine the average pulse duration of FEL beams.
<br> <br> 
Visual_interface_master allows for quick data analysis given any set of spectral data in h5 format. <br>
All source code in src, data in data folder for each branch. <br>
--> Master branch aimed for final usage. <br>
--> Fast and slow fit contains old version where running of the main code was split into a fast and a slow component.<br>
--> Median filter and moving average branches contain source code using a different initial filter, as opposed to the lowpass filter used in master and other branches. <br>
--> Notebooks worth saving contain results from previous model analysis. <br>
--> Visual demonstration demonstrates the entire master branch code visually, for a single spectrum chosen from the input dataset.
